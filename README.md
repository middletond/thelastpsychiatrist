# The Last Psychiatrist
The posts from [thelastpsychiatrist.com blog](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com) as JSON data.

## Current Condition
The data still has problems, which I am working on:
1. Categorized entries need to be aggregated with non-categorized ones, as many of them as actually the same entry
2. Image captions are not always correct (formatting varies wildly across years)
3. Posts should be initially ordered by date
4. Comment count and votes should be integers
