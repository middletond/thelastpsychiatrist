# The Last Psychiatrist
The posts from [thelastpsychiatrist.com](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com) as JSON data.

## Current Condition
The data still has problems, which I am working on:
+ Categorized entries need to be aggregated with non-categorized ones, as many of them as actually the same entry
+ Image captions are not always correct (formatting varies wildly across years)
+ Posts should be initially ordered by date
+ Comment count and votes should be integers
